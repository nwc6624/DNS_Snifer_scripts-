Python script that logs the time every time you change websites using the webbrowser and time modules
'''

import webbrowser
import time

# Define a function to log the time when the user changes websites
def log_time(url):
    with open("website_logs.txt", "a") as file:
        timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        file.write(f"{timestamp} - {url}\n")

# Set the URLs to open in the web browser
urls = ["https://www.google.com", "https://www.python.org", "https://www.github.com"]

# Open each URL in the web browser and log the time
for url in urls:
    webbrowser.open(url)
    log_time(url)
    time.sleep(5) # wait for 5 seconds before opening the next URL
